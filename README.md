# End-to-End-Weather-Classification
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict different weather types—Rainy, Sunny, Cloudy, and Snowy—using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to accurately classify weather types based on features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover.
